# three-way_clustering

B.G. Mirkin, D.I. Babin

In this work we try to extract triplets of "requirements" - "responsibilities" - "working conditions" from vacancies text to analyze current market trends in IT industry.
We have scraped approximately 30k job postings on most popular IT jobs, such as "Data scientist", "Web Developer" etc.
This data was analysed for most occuring terms in req/resp/work.cond to extract triplets of interest and analyze their co-ocurences after clusterization with algorithm proposed by my mentor B.G.Mirkin of three-way clustering.

This is still a work in progress as I'm experimenting with implementing NLP algorithms to further automate feature extraction and accuracy of results.

The project work involved: data scraping, text data preprocessing, researching and implementing NLP techniques for feature extraction, results interpretation.
